"Unity, like all game engines, has a specific set of tools, which are designed to help make specific kinds of games. These tools can be very useful when developing games that align with their strengths but can also impose their specific considerations on designers, negatively impacting their creative goals. It is important to understand when the tools start to impose upon our designs. Using the knowledge and exposure to the engine developed in the first 4 weeks of class, students will create a small interactive experience that works against the goals of Unity. Topics to consider could be, but are not limited to: physics systems, 3d+2d environments, controller schemes, lighting."

So what if a typing game, but it was the worst thing you ever played and you could literally only type like 13 words in 6 minutes?
